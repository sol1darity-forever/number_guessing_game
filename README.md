# Number Guessing Game

This is a small Python project where the computer picks a random number, and you have to guess what it is.  
After each guess, the program tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the files  
2. Make sure Python is installed on your computer  
3. Run the game:

Hi! Welcome to a number guessing game!
You’re allowed to choose the range of numbers yourself and have seven attempts to guess the number between this range. Good luck!

Enter the first number:
30
Enter the second number:
60
Enter your guess:
44
Too low!
Enter your guess:
33
Too low!
Enter your guess:
29
Too low!
Enter your guess:
55
Too high!
Enter your guess:
45
Too low!
Enter your guess:
45
Too low!
Enter your guess:
45
You lost! The number was 54. Better luck next time!

That’s the whole game — quick to play, and a good way to practice Python basics like random numbers, loops, and conditions.
